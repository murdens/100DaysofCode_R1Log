# 100DaysofCode_R1Log

Log to document my first 100 days of code challenge.  

# In summary
It's fair to say much of what I've achieved in this 100 days has only happened by committing to the challenge and putting the work in, as much as I could between work and child commitments. The #100DaysofCode Twitter community has been a great support and has really driven me to get through some of the brick walls I hit.  
I may no longer be documenting my learning path on Twitter for the time being but do plan to continue learning mainly focused on Java and android and will be cheering everyone else on.

🏁2️⃣6️⃣ #100DaysofCode @TheOdinProject

What: Taking a break today. Busy work day. 

I've looked at the worked solution for Caesars Cipher. I would not have come up with that on my own 26 days in. Similar maths but not the succinct code structure, all arrow functions..Will spend some time tomorrow breaking it down to understand further. Little demotivating.

🏁4️⃣3️⃣#100DaysofCode @TheOdinProject 

What: Carried on with Pomodoro project. Struggling with some of the JS. Added reset button with a clearInterval. If I start clock again it carries on from last time?? Also want to take form inputs to set clock times times, need to read more on that. This could take me a while.

🏁4️⃣4️⃣#100DaysofCode @TheOdinProject

Feels: Fun, fun, fun, although I don't agree hexadecimal is human readable 🤯.

Work: So far rendered 🌈 scanlines using Stella emulator.

5️⃣0️⃣ #100Daysofcode

Work: No time to sit at my laptop and had to make use of bus commute. Video lesson on TIA screen objects part of learning assembly by making Atari games course. Also signed up to a pure CSS image course, watched 2 videos but no hands on yet.

Feels: I was hoping my 50th day had been a little more productive.

Work: https://github.com/murdens/Atari_assembly/blob/master/README.md

5️⃣5️⃣  #100Daysofcode

What: I won't be doing much practical tonight as need to catch up on sleep. 

I've been reading through some original Atari game source code so far today. I need more practice on the basics  Found more online tutorials so I will do those and then make updates to the bomber game as I learn.

If you have an appreciation of assembly, is Java a good next step? I am interested in cloud, IoT and mobile. I'm holding back from jumping back up to front end for now.

5️⃣6️⃣  #100daysofcode 

Slow few days tbh due to fun stuff: My youngests birthday today 🥳. Not so fun stuff: Ever escalating Covid19 impacts on work and life. Hard to concentrate. Probably shouldn't count today.

What: Downloaded Android Studio 🥳. Started another Assembly Atari tutorial.

5️⃣7️⃣  #100daysofcode 

What: Working through Atari tutorial to go over some basics again. https://www.randomterrain.com/atari-2600-memories-tutorial-andrew-davie-09.html

Feels: This is so hard ! 

 #100DaysofCode

Probably should by my day 60 post as taken about 2 hours today in between schooling kids, thankfully don't work Mondays.
Despite world madness I'm so happy right now. Managed to overcome hardware limitations somewhat and launch app in online emulator. Very slow as needs min 4GB RAM, I got 5GB on VM.

6️⃣0️⃣ #100daysofcode 

What: Not much to report on. Working through Udacity Android basic courses, so far just XML.

Feels: so far straightforward. Needed after homeschooling. Hope it ramps up quickly though. 

6️⃣1️⃣ #100daysofcode 

What: Udacity android basics: building layouts. Had a scan through some of the android developer documentation and a play around with attributes. Onto user input next.

Feels:I had a little power nap before I started and now I'm wide awake, joy! Pretty fun trying things out but need sleep.

Work: https://github.com/murdens/AndroidApps2/tree/master/CourtCounter

6️⃣2️⃣ #100daysofcode 

What: Udacity android basics user input 1 & 2. Just Java app. Nested views, objects, variables, scope. Button colour clashing with app banner (my eyes!). Just threw an image on.

Feels: Took a bit of effort to get my brain going tonight on this now a very late post.

6️⃣3️⃣ #100daysofcode 

What: Continuing the Udacity android series of tutorials. More on methods and onto Java objects and classes tomorrow. At least it looks a little familiar.

Feels: Nice to actually code in daylight hours today.

6️⃣4️⃣ #100daysofcode 

What: Part 1 of OOP in android. This section covered so many things; methods, creating objects, class vs instance, inheritance. Found out small pop up message to user is called a toast.

Feels: nice to lose yourself in code to distract from the world drama.

6️⃣5️⃣ #100daysofcode 

What: More OOP on android, updating Java app checkboxes, conditionals. Had a play adjusting a free use image using GIMP (so many buttons and menus!)

Feels: actually got lost in coding tonight, so many WhatsApp to catch up on.

6️⃣6️⃣ #100daysofcode 

What: Completed android user input course, tonight covered intents, creating styles, themes. Moving onto multiscreen course next, more intents, arrays, loops.

Feels: Bit frustrated, can't link up phone, maybe its the VM stopping it being recognised. Can't use emulator in VM either. Might need to try windows set up.

Work: https://github.com/murdens/AndroidApps2/blob/master/JustJava/README.md

6️⃣7️⃣ #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: Udacity multiscreen app course, Implicit & explicit intents, EventListeners, moving onto arrays, arraylists next time.

6️⃣9️⃣ #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: Udacity android multiscreen course-lesson 3&4. Added images and new method. Multiple constructors for no image / image display.

Feels: Think I just went through motions without fully understanding tonight. Reflect tomorrow and onto adding audio.

7️⃣0️⃣ #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: Udacity android multiscreen course. A side project to create 'simple' media player before adding audio to course app.

Feels: I struggled a little with this. I can tell I've not been absorbing as much as I thought. Time to slow it down. Reminding myself this is my hobby.

7️⃣1️⃣-7️⃣3️⃣ #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: ✅Udacity multiscreen course, covered audiomanager/audiofocus & activity lifecycle. Java OOP inheritance, super class. Doing more Java OOP tutorials.

Feels: Slow and steady.

7️⃣5️⃣#100daysofcode #androiddev

What: More on OOP using various sources. Udacity JSON parsing module- setting up Earthquake app. Created class, object with getters and set up custom ArrayAdapter to display objects.

Feels: Starting to make more sense but some elements still seem more magic than science.

7️⃣6️⃣#100daysofcode #androiddev

What: Watched more tutorials on OO principles. Udacity JSON parsing - Traversing, parsing a JSON. Had to split a string, I did the below, is there a better way?

Feels: Got stuck a couple of times, walked away then came back to it. One task left for this lesson.

7️⃣7️⃣ part 1 #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: Made a really basic app for the girls Easter egg hunt when back from their dads.  I'm sure it can be much improved but it's a little bit of last minute fun to use some of what I've learned so far.
Will be back to other work later.

Work: https://github.com/murdens/AndroidApps2/blob/master/BunnyEgg/README.md

7️⃣7️⃣ part 2 #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: There's so much to learn in making android apps. Spent some time on material design earlier, plus working on a splash screen for Earthquake app before I start the Networking part of Udacity course. Now going old skool with a read of Java book before bed.

7️⃣8️⃣  #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: Few things:

Udacity lesson on HTTP requests and reading input stream.

First stage of google books API project. Spent more time looking at colours, typography, finding app icon than parsing JSON, that needs work and 🤔 how to parse/display thumbnail images.

Feels: Tonights session felt pretty chill.

8️⃣4️⃣#100daysofcode #androiddev

Late post
What: Debugged Google books JSON parse, still not displaying authors quite right. Started on user input activity for url query. Needs hooking up, figuring out how.

Feels: session cut short by daughter not able to sleep, didnt get to post last night. 

8️⃣5️⃣#100daysofcode #androiddev

What: UI search activity added. Thumbnail images added using Glide, bit laggy. Not sure if there is a way for the ListItemView to retain last list, listing moves around when jump back to app.

Feels: App crash, after app crash, after app crash, having a break while it works for now 🙂

8️⃣5️⃣ part 2 #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: Cleaned up the Google book search project (bookends) & changed some of the look.

8️⃣6️⃣ #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: As I did over 6 hrs on back to back video calls today, day 86 is purely Java book time, no more screen. Sat down in the sunshine to read about constructors, then numbers and stats.

A little recap of inheritance, interfaces and polymorphism.

8️⃣7️⃣ #100daysofcode #androiddev

Late post

What: Learning about fragments to add search preference/filter to book app.I sat staring at the screen working out how to hook up a second url build and pass to loader then fell asleep!

Maybe tonight..

Work: https://github.com/murdens/AndroidApps2/blob/master/BookEnds/README.md

8️⃣8️⃣ #100daysofcode #androiddev

The new read arrived (thanks for recommendation @CharithRathnay4 ).

It's been really full on at work, if I see another spreadsheet I might lose it 😂. Bit of a premature  post but I know my eyes cannot take any more screen so it will be a book read instead. My app problem will have to wait till  tomorrow.

8️⃣9️⃣#100daysofcode #androiddev

What: Started with SQLite - last of the Udacity basic Android development courses. It's a long time since I used SQL but basic CRUD commands I do remember. Next time see how to make use of database in android app.

9️⃣0️⃣ #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: Lesson 2 Udacity Data storage. Created database using SQLiteOpenHelper and inserted data from user input. Just started next section on content providers. Much of the android documentation talks now about Room also LiveData and ViewModel so after this course I might skip to Codelabs tutorials to understand more.

Feels: a little overwhelmed, so much to app building.

Work: no pretty UI yet 

9️⃣1️⃣ #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: Mostly housekeeping android apps on Github to date, updated a number of READme with gifs and screenshots.

Back to course tomorrow.

9️⃣2️⃣ #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: Back to the Udacity data storage course.

Mega lesson on content providers, URIs, and then setup of cursor adapter to inflate listview in app. 

Last part is to use cursorloader to move data loads to background.

Feels: my brain just took in a lot of content, need to wind it down, bit of Brooklyn99.

9️⃣3️⃣ break due to work

9️⃣4️⃣ #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: Udacity course section, using CursorLoader to run query in background against content provider. Added to the app but its not running. Debug tomorrow.

Feels: Only squeezed an hour in before bed. Tiredness set in.

9️⃣5️⃣ #100daysofcode #androiddev

What: Didn't post this update last night as spent an hour trying to debug app and #failed. I tried again this morning and still no joy, hopefully I will have success by the end of this day 9️⃣6️⃣ with more focus later. Baking with kids now.

What: Finished up the final basic android course on Udacity - pets database app complete. Working on some add ons now to include images and change some of the UI. Spent ages trying to workout why even after incrementing db version new column not found. 1 missing space!!

What: Been working on adding images to pet database. Trickier than I thought it would be (for me anyway).

I can edit and update an existing pet but it's not displaying when I add new. Bugs to clear.

What: Happy I fixed the add pet option earlier. Started adding preference fragment to filter or sort database, not yet functional. 

Changed display to gridview. 

Added dialogue for delete all option.

Started splash screen.

Feels: 2 days left!

What:Spent about 3 hrs trying to figure out another bug. Added preferences to sort & filter this works. The prefs are holding  selection, when go to delete the filter input, sometimes it redisplays full table,sometimes app crashes. I can see in log, when text deleted, filter is blank but not empty. Think this is the problem.

Last day of the challenge, what a ride it's been. I haven't decided if I'll do R2 but will be continuing on a Java / Android journey.  Android studio has been upgrading for hours so have been reading up on spring physics animation, not the way I wanted to end R1 :)
